# Netlify Redirects for SPA (Single Page Application)
# Documentation: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

# Standard Netlify SPA rewrite for React Router
# All unknown paths serve index.html (200 = rewrite, keeps URL)
# This is the recommended pattern from Netlify docs for Vite/React SPAs
/*    /index.html    200

# Note: This is also configured in netlify.toml as a backup.
# Having it in both places ensures SPA routing works correctly.

# Future: Add specific redirects here if needed
# Example: Redirect old URLs to new ones
# /old-path    /new-path    301

# Example: Proxy API requests to an external service
# /api/*    https://api.example.com/:splat    200
