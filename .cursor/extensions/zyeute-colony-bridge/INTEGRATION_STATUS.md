## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The bridge is ready for integration testing:

1. **Connection Test**: Verify TI-Guy connects to swarm
2. **Consultation Test**: Test multi-agent responses
3. **Content Generation Test**: Test swarm content creation
4. **Fallback Test**: Verify single-agent fallback works

## 📝 Notes

- All code follows React Native/JavaScript patterns (not TypeScript)
- Swarm adapter gracefully handles connection failures
- Quebec context sync happens on initialization
- Telemetry sent to Colony OS for learning
